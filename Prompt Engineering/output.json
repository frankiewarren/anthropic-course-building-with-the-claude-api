    "reasoning": "While the solution provides excellent nutritional principles and food recommendations for a badminton athlete with lactose intolerance, it critically fails the mandatory requirements by not specifying daily caloric intake, exact meal portions, and a structured meal timeline. The nutritional strategy is sound, but lacks the precise implementation details required for an athlete's meal plan."
